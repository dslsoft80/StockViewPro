StockViewPro is a premium Power BI custom visual that enables some features that only avaiable in professional tools. 

Prerequisite:

You just need to ensure your data source contains following fields:
    Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume

Info:

This visual follows the normal candle stick chart properties being red for bearish and green for bullish. If the open and close price remain the same, neither red nor green is shown. Instead, you just see a dark cross with wick.

You will also see two non-intefering sections once the chart is rendered. The top chart shows the price change and the bottom part shows the corresponding volume. Both charts are equipped with different axises and both axises are designed to autoscale therefore no need to set manuall.

You will also see a text area at the top area of the chart. It's very self-explanatory and you should the values change automatically as your crosshair moves along date axis. Similarly, when your crosshair moves vertically, depending on your chart area (price or volme), you will see price or volume value automatically.

Usage:

Once data is loaded and proper license is acquired, you may just add date field and other required fields. Then your stock view will be presented. Howver, changing external filter or slicer value will reset the state of the chart.

As soon as you move cursor into the chart area, a crosshair will appear and you may use the crosshair to manuvour. You can use mouse wheel to zoom in and out. The zoom will occur near where the cursor is. Once you chart is zoomed in, you may press the mouse button and drag the chart to move horizontally.

You may also make selection(s) in other visuals and this will hight the corresponding dates in your StockProView chart and vice versa.

Limitation:

It is recommended to restrict the volume of data (e.g. 180 rows). You may still load as many as you want but you may lose distinct view of r(ed and green at the level of overview.
